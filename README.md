# PySail
[2/2/2016] Started working on PySail 2, anything below is about PySail 1.

[9/5/2015] 1.0 Release, finally playable.

Intro:
Sailing game I'm making because I have tried many sailing games, most of them were not good in my opinion and the few ones that were more or less good didn't fully reach my expectations (or shall I say, didn't have what I wanted).
So, I chose to make my own.

The menu is in the console that opens at the beggining.

Controls:
CTRL = Pull in sail.
SHIFT = Release sail.
G,F,Left = Turn 5, 10, 15 degrees left.
H,J, Right = Turn 5, 10, 15 degrees right.
